The problem sets are organized into one Rails application called 'basics'. Each problem set has its own branch on the repository. 

For example, the branch PS1 will only have PS1 implemented in the app and the branch PS2 will have PS2 AND PS1 implemented and so on.

All work is merged to the master branch.
